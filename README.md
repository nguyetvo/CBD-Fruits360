# Fruit classification 

Use Deep Learning and this dataset to predict kind of fruit as the given image. This project should follow the guideline as:

1. Perform data exploration (group images, do clustering analysis for images, display images for analysis, etc.).

2. Use CNN with classification_report to do prediction.

3. Tune the models if necessary.

4. Use separate test set images to verify model accuracy.
